*********************************************************   Z - Bin Raspberry Pi  ******************************************************

Waste can be regarded as a human concept as there appears to be no such thing as waste in nature. Overflowing garbage bins have been another cause of concern for residents in developing countries. With increase in population, the scenario of cleanliness with respect to garbage management is degrading tremendously.

To address this problem, this project tries to create an IOT based solution that will overcome the gradual increase of the improper waste disposal methodologies. The smart garbage bin discussed in this book allows people to continue a proper garbage dispense effortlessly. Another vital benefit of creating the product is to fulfill customer satisfaction thereby bringing the product more user friendly and affordable at the same time.

In the future the project is to be developed in various ways regarding technology wise as well as design wise. The Smart Garbage Bin will consist with a more developed integrated vacuum cleaner and by installing a voice recognition module the Z bin will be more user friendly and effective.

To be concluded the problems are addressed accordingly with the smart garbage bin solution This smart garbage bin may lead to make the household environment cleaner and also this smart way of disposing will ease the day to day life of the people.or Automatic LED Control 

The purpose of this project is to design, develop and evaluate “smart garbage disposal system" and mobile app which basically works according to the motion detection technology.This product will target the indoor garbage users to have a proper and effective disposalsystem. The Z bin primarily consist of three main sensors. They are,

           Infrared sensor

           Ultrasonic sensor

           Weight sensor

Ultra-sonic sensors measure the depth of the bin and return the bin percentage as an alert.Infrared sensors detect the motions of the user and open the lid when the user wave the hand.And the weight sensor measures the weightage of the garbage bag and give the exact amount of weight. In order to make the project more unique and effective we have added a vacuum cleaner to the System. We can sweep dirt, dust and food crumbs into the integrated vacuum inlet and the z bin’s suction will automatically deposit debris directly into the vacuum bag, so no more dustpans or bending over.
