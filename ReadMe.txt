*********************************************************   Z - Bin Raspberry Pi  ******************************************************

The purpose of this project is to design, develop and evaluate “smart garbage disposal system" and mobile app which basically works according to the motion detection technology.This product will target the indoor garbage users to have a proper and effective disposalsystem. The Z bin primarily consist of three main sensors. They are,

           Infrared sensor

           Ultrasonic sensor

           Weight sensor

Ultra-sonic sensors measure the depth of the bin and return the bin percentage as an alert.Infrared sensors detect the motions of the user and open the lid when the user wave the hand.And the weight sensor measures the weightage of the garbage bag and give the exact amount of weight. In order to make the project more unique and effective we have added a vacuum cleaner to the System. We can sweep dirt, dust and food crumbs into the integrated vacuum inlet and the z bin’s suction will automatically deposit debris directly into the vacuum bag, so no more dustpans or bending over.
